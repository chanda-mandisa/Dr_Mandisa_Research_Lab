# 🔄 Reaction Mechanism Animator

This tool animates step-by-step organic reaction mechanisms, helping students and researchers visualize electron flow, intermediates, and the logic behind transformations. It's free, interactive, and perfect for learning and teaching.


## 🧬 Description

Users can:
- Select a reaction from the built-in library:
  - SN1, SN2  
  - E1, E2  
  - Electrophilic addition  
  - Nucleophilic substitution  
  - Aromatic substitution (planned)  
- Watch step-by-step animations showing:
  - Curved arrows for electron movement  
  - Intermediates and products  
  - Transition state labels (optional)
- Color-coded atoms and reactive centers
- (Planned) Add your own custom steps to animate mechanisms


## 🎯 Use Cases

- Organic chemistry lecture visualization  
- Student practice and self-study  
- Research presentations and mechanism explanation  
- Science communication and outreach

This project supports the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** mission of blending creativity and science for a more intuitive, visual, and ethical approach to education.

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add custom reaction builder for user-defined mechanisms  
- Implement reaction coordinate diagram with energy profile overlay  
- Add export options (GIF, MP4, step-by-step PNGs)  
- Build quiz mode ("choose the next arrow" or "predict the intermediate")  
- Support organometallic and catalytic cycles


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – backend logic and animation control  
- **RDKit / Open Babel** – molecule drawing and atom mapping  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly / PyMolDraw** – animation rendering  
- **Streamlit / Tkinter** *(planned)* – interactive GUI  
- **JSON** – storing mechanism steps and labels
