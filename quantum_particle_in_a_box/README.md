# ⚛️ Quantum Particle in a Box

This simulator models the classic particle-in-a-box quantum system, helping users visualize quantized energy levels and wavefunctions. Designed for education and experimentation, it's free, interactive, and deeply visual.


## 🧬 Description

The simulation supports:
- 1D infinite potential well (quantum box)
- Adjustable:
  - Box length `L` (in nm)  
  - Particle mass `m` (e.g., electron, proton)  
  - Quantum number `n` (1, 2, 3...)  
- Outputs:
  - Energy of each level (Eₙ)  
  - Wavefunction plot ψₙ(x)  
  - Probability density |ψₙ(x)|²  


## 🎓 Educational + Research Goals

This project is part of the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** initiative to make theoretical science visual, open, and interactive.

Use cases:
- Intro quantum mechanics lectures and homework  
- Chemistry and physics course support  
- Visual comparison of classical vs quantum behavior  
- Tool for exploring quantization intuitively

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add 2D and 3D simulation support  
- Implement time-dependent Schrödinger animation  
- Compare to classical particle motion  
- Export plots for use in reports or slides  
- Build Streamlit or Tkinter GUI for drag-and-drop interactivity


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – main simulation logic  
- **NumPy / SciPy** – equations and numerical integration  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** – wavefunction visualization  
- **Streamlit** *(planned)* – GUI for parameter control and animations
