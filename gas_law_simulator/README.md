# 🧪 Gas Law Simulator

This simulator models the relationships between pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas using classical gas laws. Designed for education and applied research, it offers a free and open tool to explore how gases behave under various conditions.


## 🧬 Description

The simulator supports:
- **Ideal Gas Law**: PV = nRT  
- Solve for any variable (P, V, n, or T) by providing the others  
- Visualize relationships like:
  - Pressure vs Volume (Boyle’s Law)
  - Volume vs Temperature (Charles’ Law)
  - Pressure vs Temperature (Gay-Lussac’s Law)
- Unit conversion support:
  - Pressure: atm, kPa, mmHg
  - Temperature: K, °C
  - Volume: L, m³

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Chemistry classrooms and labs  
- Engineering and environmental gas studies  
- Simulating experimental setups before lab work  
- Creating visual aids for reports or lectures

As part of the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab**, this tool reinforces scientific literacy and makes quantitative chemistry more accessible.

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add real gas correction (van der Waals equation)  
- Build interactive slider-based interface  
- Support batch input and CSV exports  
- Add animation mode for pressure/volume changes over time  
- Include quiz or tutorial mode for students


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – core calculations and logic  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** – for visualization  
- **NumPy** – numerical computation  
- **Pint** – unit conversion and dimensional analysis  
- **Streamlit / Tkinter** *(planned)* – GUI interface
