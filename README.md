# Dr. Mandisa Research Lab

## Welcome to the Dr. Mandisa Research Lab — an open-source, community-driven space for exploring and developing computational research methods across all STEM fields.

### Overview

This repository serves as a digital hub for creating, sharing, and disseminating tools, data, and projects that make computational research more accessible, collaborative, and impactful. While the lab has roots in computational chemistry, its scope is intentionally interdisciplinary — spanning biology, physics, environmental science, engineering, data science, and more.
Mission

Our goal is to democratize research by using open-source technologies and free resources, ensuring that anyone — regardless of financial or institutional support — can contribute to and benefit from cutting-edge computational tools and methods.
Core Principles

    - Open Access: All tools, datasets, and code are publicly available.

    - Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Designed for use in any STEM discipline where computation adds value.

    - Community Contributions: If you find a project that resonates with you, you're welcome to contribute.

    - Simplicity & Clarity: We aim to build frameworks and tools that are easy to understand, modify, and expand.
