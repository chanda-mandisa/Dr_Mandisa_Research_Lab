# üß¨ DNA-RNA Visualizer

This tool allows users to input DNA sequences and view their RNA transcriptions and protein translations in a visual, color-coded format. Built for education, outreach, and open research, it brings molecular biology to life.


## üß¨ Description

With this tool, users can:
- Input DNA sequences and view mRNA, tRNA, or amino acid chains  
- See codons color-coded for easier understanding  
- Identify start and stop codons, UTRs, and mutation sites  
- Step through transcription and translation processes visually  
- Export visualizations for reports or teaching slides


## üéì Educational + Research Goals

This project supports the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** mission to expand access to high-quality, open-source scientific tools.

Applications include:
- Classroom demonstrations of central dogma concepts  
- Research presentations with clean sequence visuals  
- Analysis of coding regions, mutations, and base pairing


## üìÅ Files



## üß† Next Steps

- Add support for FASTA file parsing  
- Create animation mode (step-by-step transcription/translation)  
- Support exon/intron highlighting for eukaryotic genes  
- Build browser-based GUI with Streamlit or Tkinter  
- Include mutation simulation and codon comparison tool


## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì primary scripting language  
- **Biopython** ‚Äì biological sequence handling  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** ‚Äì for sequence visualization  
- **Streamlit** *(planned)* ‚Äì for interactive GUI  
- **Regular expressions** ‚Äì for sequence pattern recognition
