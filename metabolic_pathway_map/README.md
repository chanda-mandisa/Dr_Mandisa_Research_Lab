# 🧬 Metabolic Pathway Map

This interactive map visualizes core metabolic processes in the cell, making biochemistry more accessible for learners and researchers. From glycolysis to fatty acid metabolism, each step is clickable, educational, and data-rich.


## 🧬 Description

The map includes:
- Major cellular pathways:  
  - Glycolysis  
  - TCA Cycle  
  - Electron Transport Chain  
  - Amino Acid Synthesis/Degradation  
  - Lipid Metabolism
- Interactive features:
  - Click to view molecule structures and reaction summaries  
  - Hover for enzyme names, coenzymes, and byproducts  
  - Highlight regulated steps or energy-producing reactions  
  - (Planned) Trace carbons from glucose to CO₂ or biomass


## 🎓 Educational + Research Goals

This project supports the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** mission of building intuitive and open scientific tools. It’s designed to:
- Replace static posters with interactive, dynamic learning  
- Aid in studying for exams (MCAT, GRE, biochem courses)  
- Provide researchers with annotated visual summaries for presentations  
- Serve as a launchpad for modeling metabolic flux or systems biology

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add zoom and pan to navigate large maps  
- Implement search and filter tools (e.g., “show all redox reactions”)  
- Integrate 2D molecular structures from PubChem or KEGG  
- Build Streamlit or PyVis-based browser interface  
- Enable pathway tracing mode and energy yield analysis


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – for backend logic and data handling  
- **NetworkX / PyVis** – pathway map visualization  
- **Streamlit / Dash** *(planned)* – interactive GUI  
- **RDKit** – (planned) for molecular visualization  
- **PubChem / KEGG API** – for structural and enzymatic metadata
