# 📈 Calibration Curve Generator

This tool creates calibration curves from known standard data, allowing users to quantify unknown samples using best-fit models. Designed for researchers, students, and educators, it replaces expensive proprietary software with a free and open-source alternative.


## 🧬 Description

The Calibration Curve Generator accepts numerical input for known concentrations and corresponding instrument responses (e.g., absorbance, fluorescence). It outputs:

- A best-fit curve (linear by default, nonlinear planned)
- Slope, intercept, and R² values
- Estimated concentration of unknown samples
- A visual plot of data and regression line


## 🎯 Use Cases

- Spectrophotometric quantification  
- Drug assays and dissolution studies  
- Food and beverage testing  
- Environmental monitoring (e.g., water contaminants)

This project supports the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** mission of creating accessible, ethical, and open scientific tools.
