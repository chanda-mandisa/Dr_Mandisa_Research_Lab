# 💧 Solubility Rules Quiz

This interactive quiz tool helps students learn and master aqueous solubility rules through repetition, logic, and instant feedback. It’s open-source, fast, and designed to make chemistry review feel like a game—not a chore.


## 🧬 Description

The quiz includes:
- Questions like:
  - “Is BaSO₄ soluble in water?”  
  - “Which of the following is always soluble?”  
- Multiple-choice, true/false, or short answer formats  
- Instant feedback with explanation of the rule applied  
- Topics include:
  - Nitrates, alkali metals, halides, sulfates, carbonates, phosphates, hydroxides, and more


## 🎯 Use Cases

- High school and college-level general chemistry  
- Exam review or flashcard replacement  
- Lab prep for precipitation reactions  
- Independent learners reviewing key concepts

As part of the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab**, this project supports equity in science education by making repetitive content more engaging, accessible, and memorable.

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add adaptive learning mode (repeat what you got wrong)  
- Include ionic breakdown explanation (cation + anion logic)  
- Support “challenge mode” with timer or streak-based scoring  
- Build mobile-friendly GUI using Streamlit or Flask  
- Export quiz results to study log or PDF report


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – quiz engine and logic  
- **JSON** – rule database and exceptions  
- **Streamlit / Tkinter / Flask** *(planned)* – GUI interface  
- **Pandas** *(optional)* – for scoring and logging answers
