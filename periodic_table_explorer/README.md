# 🧪 Periodic Table Explorer

An interactive, open-source periodic table that allows users to explore atomic trends, compare properties, and access detailed chemical data in an intuitive and dynamic format.


## 🧬 Description

Features:
- Full interactive periodic table
- Hover or click on any element to see:
  - Symbol, name, atomic number, and atomic mass  
  - Electron configuration (long + shorthand)  
  - Group, block, period  
  - Electronegativity, atomic radius, ionization energy  
- Color themes based on:
  - Element groups (alkali metals, halogens, etc.)  
  - Physical state (solid/liquid/gas)  
  - Metallic character or orbital blocks


## 🎓 Educational + Research Goals

This tool supports the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** mission of providing clear, visual, and engaging science tools for learners and researchers.

Use cases include:
- High school and university chemistry education  
- Quick reference for properties in research settings  
- Visual trend spotting and property comparisons  
- Foundation for other chemistry tools (e.g., configuration, bonding, simulations)


## 📁 Files



## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add trend visualization toggles (atomic radius, EN, IE, etc.)  
- Build Streamlit browser GUI with search + filters  
- Integrate with other tools (e.g., MO Visualizer, Electron Configuration)  
- Add quiz mode for element or property matching  
- Enable CSV and PNG export of selected element sets


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – backend logic and data processing  
- **JSON** – structured periodic table data  
- **Pandas** – for filtering and exporting properties  
- **Plotly / PyVis / Streamlit** – (planned) GUI and visuals  
- **Colorama / Seaborn** *(optional)* – for styling themes and data heatmaps
