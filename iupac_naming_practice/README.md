# 🧾 IUPAC Naming Practice

This educational tool helps students and researchers practice naming organic molecules using IUPAC conventions. It offers quiz-style drills, structure validation, and intelligent hints to reinforce core organic chemistry concepts.


## 🧬 Description

Users can:
- Name a displayed compound structure (SMILES input or visual)
- Enter an IUPAC name and receive correctness feedback
- Practice by functional group or difficulty level
- Get real-time hints or corrections for incorrect names
- (Planned) Convert correct IUPAC names back into structural diagrams


Covers:
- Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes  
- Branched hydrocarbons  
- Halogenated compounds  
- Alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids  
- Aromatics and more (coming soon)


## 🎯 Use Cases

- Organic chemistry students preparing for exams  
- Instructors building interactive learning activities  
- Self-taught chemists reviewing naming rules  
- Researchers checking complex structure names quickly

This tool is part of the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** initiative to provide intelligent, free, open-source STEM education tools for all learners.

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add structure-to-name and name-to-structure dual mode  
- Include images or generated diagrams in quiz questions  
- Support stereochemistry and E/Z or R/S naming  
- Track performance over time for spaced repetition  
- Build browser GUI for interactive practice with progress saving


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – quiz logic and parsing  
- **RDKit** – chemical structure processing and name generation  
- **Open Babel** – alternate format conversion (optional)  
- **Streamlit** *(planned)* – GUI interface  
- **JSON** – for quiz bank and answer key management
