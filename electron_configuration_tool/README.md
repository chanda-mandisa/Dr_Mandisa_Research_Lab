# ⚛️ Electron Configuration Tool

This tool generates electron configurations for any element based on its atomic number or symbol. Built as a free, open-source educational resource, it visualizes atomic structure according to quantum mechanical principles.


## 🧬 Description

Users can input any element and the tool will output:
- Full ground-state electron configuration
- Noble gas shorthand
- Subshell-by-subshell filling using the Aufbau principle
- Optional orbital diagram with arrows and boxes
- Support for common exceptions and transition elements


## 🎓 Educational + Research Goals

This project supports the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** mission of promoting scientific literacy through open-access tools. It is especially useful for:
- High school and college chemistry students  
- Instructors preparing visual teaching materials  
- Researchers reviewing electron configurations for molecular modeling

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Implement orbital box diagrams (e.g., 1s ↑↓ 2s ↑↓ 2p ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑)  
- Add support for excited states and ions  
- Integrate periodic table interface with element picker  
- Build Streamlit-based GUI for browser use  
- Add quiz and practice mode for learners


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – logic and rules engine  
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting orbital diagrams  
- **Streamlit** *(planned)* – for GUI  
- **JSON/CSV** – for periodic data storage
