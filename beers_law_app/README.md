# 🔬 Beer's Law App

This interactive tool models the fundamental relationship between absorbance and concentration based on **Beer's Law**. It’s designed as both a teaching aid and a research prototype for spectrophotometric method development.


## 🧬 Description

Using Python and Matplotlib, this app simulates how changes in concentration affect the absorbance of a solution, using the equation:

> A = ε × l × c

Where:  
- A = Absorbance  
- ε = Molar absorptivity (L/mol·cm)  
- l = Path length (cm)  
- c = Concentration (mol/L)

This tool supports:
- Forward calculation of absorbance from known concentration  
- Reverse estimation of unknown concentration from absorbance  
- Visualization of the linear relationship (or deviations)  
- Custom input for molar absorptivity and path length


## 🎓 Educational + Research Goals

This subproject supports the broader mission of the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab**:  
**to make scientific modeling tools accessible, extensible, and relevant to both academic and applied research.**

With this app, students and scientists can:
- Explore spectrophotometry fundamentals
- Simulate and visualize experimental scenarios
- Extend the base model for real-world analytes and assays
