# üíä Drug Design Simulations

This section of the **Dr. Mandisa Research Lab** focuses on simulating how pharmaceutical compounds interact with biological systems. Projects here integrate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, chemical data parsing, and biological insight to better understand drug behavior.

## üß¨ Overview

Each subproject in this directory is a self-contained simulation or modeling tool related to a specific drug or pharmacological concept. All simulations aim to be:

- **Data-driven** using public repositories like DrugBank, ChEMBL, and PubChem  
- **Modular** and extendable to other compounds or treatment regimens  
- **Educational** tools for both researchers and students

## üß± Subprojects

| Subfolder | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`Aspirin`](./Aspirin) | Simulates aspirin‚Äôs PK/PD behavior and plots effect/concentration curves |
| _[Future folders]_ | (e.g., Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Multi-drug interaction models) |

---

## üß† Goals

- Expand simulation library to include other common pharmaceuticals  
- Support compound comparison and interaction analysis  
- Integrate database querying for ligand-target interaction data  
- Develop a web-accessible or GUI-based front-end for simulations

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì core logic, data processing, and plotting  
- **SQLite** ‚Äì local storage for compound data and simulation outputs  
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì for generating pharmacodynamic and kinetic visualizations  
- **Public chemical databases** ‚Äì for sourcing experimental or known PK/PD values
