# 🤝 Contributing to Dr. Mandisa Research Lab

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
This open lab space is a living, breathing library of science tools focused on **accessibility**, **education**, and **open knowledge**. Whether you're a scientist, student, coder, artist, or curious soul—you're welcome here.


## 🌱 Ways to Contribute

You don’t need to be a coder to help. Choose your favorite way to collaborate:

### 1. **Code Improvements**
- Add features to existing tools
- Fix bugs or improve efficiency
- Improve accessibility or layout in GUI tools

### 2. **Documentation**
- Write clearer README files
- Add usage examples or tutorials
- Translate documentation into other languages (planned)

### 3. **Scientific Content**
- Suggest new educational simulations
- Help verify formulas, models, or data
- Create diagrams or visuals for concepts

### 4. **Ideas & Feedback**
- Report a bug or confusing section
- Suggest a new project or feature
- Submit curriculum-aligned topics or use cases


## ⚙️ How to Get Started

1. **Fork** this repository (or any sub-repo)
